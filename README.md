## Problem Statement

Managing HR projects effectively in an Agile environment is a challenge. HR teams often struggle with task prioritization, monitoring progress across Agile stages, and assessing sprint performance. This simulator provides a hands-on approach to understanding and visualizing an Agile workflow tailored to HR projects.

## Solution

This project simulates an Agile workflow for HR tasks using a high-demand HR dataset. It demonstrates how to allocate tasks to Agile stages, track their progress, and measure sprint completion rates. The project aims to help HR professionals and Agile teams adopt Agile principles for better workforce planning and task management.

## Key Features

**Simulate Agile Workflow**: Assign tasks to Agile stages like Backlog, To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Completed.

**Visualize Task Distribution**: Generate a bar chart to display the number of tasks at each Agile stage.

**Calculate Metrics**: 

-Total and average story points across tasks.

-Sprint completion rates for performance evaluation.

-Simulate Sprints: Assign tasks to sprints and simulate their completion status.

## Whatâ€™s Used in the Code
